# mass_spring_cuda_test
Implement three versions of mass-spring based simulation: using classical newton method, using fast mass-spring method based on the paper Fast Simulation of Mass-Spring Systems, using modified fast mass-spring based on the paper A Chebyshev Semi-Iterative Approach for Accelerating Projective and Position-based Dynamics with a CUDA version jacobi solver acceleration.
